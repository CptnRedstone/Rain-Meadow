LOW-PRIO

Tutorialize
	emote usage
	emote wheel drag n drop
	changing skins and creatures

handholding
	would be so nice to grab cicada be carried by liz etc etc
	"it's of uttermost importance to me that one cannot troll others with this"
	either:
		- invite and accept-to-be-held; or
		- be grabbed by, with no consequences
			you are not heavier nor locked out of anything, no downsides
			Sky has both, with the invite system, but also the "follow"->"hold hand"

creature todo
- allow creature to change the creature-pipe they're going to mid-flight (very low prio)
- eggbug and lanternmouse are way too fast in zerog
- shortcutcolor for most creatures doesnt account for tint?

lizard todo
	could use proper lizard voice not default pink
	red liz uses wrong seed sometimes? unconf
	blues have trouble sticking to the ceiling (retest)
	blues have trouble climbing/pathing ledges (retest)
	lizard wallclimb is slow, slows you down a lot in zerog movemen

scav todo
	scav latching to pole with lots of momentum lets go? shelter room to drainage spot
	scav has trouble walljumping, doesn't count as walljumpable sometimes, hic02 lower spot (check?)

eggbugg todo
	regains footing mid-jump

following others around is hard
	could use pipes flashing colors if room inhabited
	player list on passage screen

accessibility
	squid had trouble in dsb06 underwater poles?
	ds a09, the crawlspace on left, creatures don't snap to crawling in it
	ds c03 exist is at water height wont path
	dsa13 corner up lizard stuck

emotes
	emotes go off-screen too often, need to show them in-screen near the creature when possible
	emote bg tint too strong, same for text

input
	throw is for switching pages on hotwheel, but also call, specially on controller
	rebindable keybinds for everything meadow
		- controller emote input
		- tab
	- people don't like locking in place while pointing
		// could combine with "look", after all just looking is kind of meh

customization
	could let one pick a tint "absolutely" limiting the range of the color-picker itself
		how do I do the same sanitization in the data though? I don't want hackers being fricks

	wolfy commented on a white-but-highly-customizable skin

menus
	redo scavenger selectscreen
	backing out of passage screen sends you to main menu? unconfirmed but plausible
